# How to use the component page MDX template

Follow these steps to add a new component page to the Salt website.

## 1. Getting started

Copy the [`component-name/`](./component-name/) folder into the [`site/docs/components/` directory](../../site/docs/components/) and rename it to your component's name in kebab case. For example `form-field/`.
   - ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** If you are using GitHub's website to edit component docs, you can press the <kbd>.</kbd> key to launch a version of VS Code in your browser and copy the directory via that. 

Read the Salt content style guide to ensure your writing maintains consistency with other documentation.
