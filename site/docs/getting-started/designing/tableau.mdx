Tableau is a data visualization tool. It allows users to create customized dashboards for business information analytics.

This guidance outlines how you can best align your Tableau dashboards with the Salt design system foundations. It's not possible to fully align Tableau designs with all of the foundations due to the tool's limitations, but this guidance will help you achieve greater visual consistency in spacing, tyopgraphy, color and icons.

The dimensions and specifications in the examples below use the medium density (MD) in light mode. To design a Tableau dashboard following other Salt densities and modes, refer to the relevant foundations where applicable.

### Spacing

Spacing refers to the organization of space to separate elements and create a consistent visual rhythm throughout a layout. Refer to the spacing foundation for further guidance on how to apply spatial tokens.

#### Layout grids

Tableau does not currently offer the ability to set and apply a layout grid with margins, columns and gutters to a dashboard.

A temporary solution is to create a layout grid, or select a grid from the Salt layout grid library, that fits the intended dashboard and density size. You can then export the grid as an SVG image at full scale from Figma, and import this into Tableau to use as a background image.

To export a layout grid from Figma:
1. Create a frame dimensioned to your dashboard size. Apply a layout grid, or select a Layout Grid from the Salt library that fits your intended dashboard size.
2. Export the frame as an SVG image using the export settings in the bottom right of the design panel.
3. Save the image within your files as an SVG.

To import a layout grid SVG into Tableau:
1. Create a new tableau dashboard with the desired viewport dimension.
2. Drag and drop an image object from the dashboard panel.
3. Select the correct layout grid file to import as an image.
4. Treat this container as a background image.
5. Place your dashboard content over the top of this base container.
6. Delete the image layer once the dashboard design is complete.

Tableau does not import images at 100% scale, and instead applies 4px outer padding across all borders by default. In the layout panel, change the padding values to 0px on all sides. This ensures any content aligned to the grid is sized and positioned accurately.

The Salt example dashboard uses an eight-column MD large grid.

Content modules
The Salt Dashboard pattern recommends using the Card component to display data within the main body region of a
dashboard. This can be achieved within Tableau instead by styling and positioning containers as panels.

Refer to the content module spacing recommendations within the dashboard pattern to better establish readability in
your dashboards.
Objects within a Tableau dashboard typically sit in either two container types - Tiled or Floating.¢
 Tiled containers do not overlap one another and instead form part of a single-layer grid that is responsive to a change in
dashboard size. Tiled containers can be nested with additional containers and use fixed width/height values for sizing.¢
 Floating containers can be layered over other objects and re-sized manually, making them easier to adjust and position.
There are three types of containers to organise elements within
j Horizontal - use a horizontal container to control the height
h Vertical - use a vertical container to control the width
f Blank - a versatile container that provides flexibility over both width and height. Blank objects are commonly used to add
spacing and help with the organisation of a layout.
Dashboards are commonly laid out with a main body region supported by a fixed panel
 Since the main body region contains panels positioned to accommodate content and maintain visual hierarchy, it is
recommended to establish a base container in tableau for additional containers to be nested within. Drag and drop a
horizontal container from the ‘Objects’ panel on the right-hand side, and re-size to the intended span of columns. The Salt
example dashboard uses a 6 column area for the main body region.
Main body
region (6
columns)
There is flexibility for a fixed panel to be either a floating or tiled container. The Salt example dashboard utilises a floating
container for flexibility of positioning and ease of adjustment.
Fixed panel (2 columns)
Nesting containers
Content layout and structure is predominantly achieved through nested containers. The different container types can be
nested within each other depending on the direction of content layout.
Horizontal parent container
Place vertical containers within a parent horizontal container
to layout content in a horizontal orientation.¢
j Place a horizontal container
h Drop multiple vertical containers within the horizontal
container
f Use blank objects to create spacing between vertical
content modules. Alternatively, apply inner padding to the
left/right edges of the vertical containers to create
padding.

Individual vertical containers

j Place a vertical container
h Drop multiple horizontal containers within the vertical

f Use blank objects to create spacing between horizontal
content modules. Alternatively, apply inner padding to the
left/right edges of the horizontal containers to create

Note: the key indicator that a blank object is being placed inside a container is the thicker, blue line around the parent
container, and the grey area being populated. Once objects have been placed, double click the handle of a lower-level object to
select the parent container. A dashed line indicates the boundaries of all where objects are placed within a parent container.
Typography
Typography enhances readability and establishes hierarchy for more effective communication. Refer to the Salt Typography
foundation for further guidance on how to apply type styles.
Note: the tableau template does not contain a font palette with the design system’s type scale, Open Sans. The font is available
within the software, however needs to be applied manually to text elements and formatted in accordance to the design
system’s recommendations.
It is also important to note the font preset sizes within Tableau do not visually render and align with the Salt equivalent
typography sizing. The Salt example dashboard has been designed in MD and therefore utilises the MD type styles. Refer to the
table below for a 1:1 conversion of the Salt typography scale for Tableau, in medium density.
Font Style Weight Salt Size Tableau Size
Body Regular 12px 10px
Body strong Semibold 12px 10px
Body small Light 12px 10px
H1 Bold 24px
H1 strong Extrabold 24px
H1 small Medium 24px
H2 Semibold 18px 14px
H2 strong Bold 18px 14px
H2 small Regular 18px 14px
H3 Semibold 14px 11px
H3 strong Bold 14px 11px
H3 small Regular 14px 11px
H4 Semibold 12px 10px
H4 strong Bold 12px 10px
H4 small Regular 12px 10px
Label Regular 11px 10px
Label strong Semibold 11px 10px
Label small Light 11px 10px
Action Semibold 12px 10px
Text objects
Drag and drop a text object from the Objects panel to add text. These can be nested within containers and have individual
padding values applied to them using the Layout panel.
Double click into a text object to edit the content and formatting. Individual parts of a single text object can be edited
separately to display it’s own type style and colour,
Metrics
The Salt example dashboard contains three pre-styled text-based metrics that can be amended for your dashboard context:¢
 Positive metric¢
 Negative metri
 Neutral metric


These can be used to represent a change from a previous value. Characters or labels can be added to help provide context to
the presented value.
Metrics are formed within Sheets which are single view worksheets or stories that can be accessed via the tabs at the bottom
of the interface. A single sheet contains editable data, shelves, cards, legends, and the Data and Analytics panes in its side bar.
A collection of sheets form a dashboard and it’s content.
To use an existing Salt metric from the file, duplicate a chosen metric tab at the bottom and rename it. It’s important to note
that an individual metric can only be used once within a dashboard, even if the design requires duplicates, this must be
represented via multiple sheets.¢
 Each time a sheet is created/duplicated, it appears under ‘Sheets’ within the Dashboard pane
 To place a sheet/metric within a dashboard, drag and drop a sheet from the list into a container
List of

sheets
Single metric
Edit text within the relevant sheet containing the metric/data. The font style, weight, size and colour can be controlled via the
“Edit Label’ panel. Different colours can also be applied to individual parts of text.
Color
Color is used to communicate meaning and establish visual hierarchy which is especially important within data visualisations.
Refer to the Salt Color foundation for further guidance on how to apply color.
There are fewer constraints when applying color within Tableau. Use a colour selector with RGB or Hex Ref input when adding
color to objects - both text and container items.
The Tableau file contains the UITK Categorical color palette to apply to data visualisation widgets. This palette is only accessible
within individual Worksheets, rather than a Dashboard view.
You can add additional custom palettes within a file manually, using the following steps:¢
j In documents locate “Preferences” file within “My Tableau RepositoryÂ
h Right-click on the file and select Open with > Notepad
This should open up a text file containing HTML of the existing color palettes within the Tableau file.¢
f Duplicate the first set of colour values and rename the palette¢
| Replace the hex values with the color values of your choic
 Add or delete color rows as needed
[ Save the file and reopen Tableau. The color palettes should now be updated with the new one under the dropdown menu.
Panels
Apply colour to containers within dashboards using the background fill via the Layout panel.
Use the following Salt tokens for panels in light mode dashboards
 Primary containers: container-primary-background (hex value FFFFFFR
 Secondary containers: container-secondary-background (hex value EAEDEF)
Text
Colour is applied to text using RGB or Hex Ref inputs. Text based sheets do not contain preset color palettes that can be
accessed similar as when creating charts. Individual colours can however be added into the ‘custom colors’ section within the
color picker for quicker reference.

Icons
Interactive Salt icons cannot be directly imported into a sheet/metric type on Tableau, due to the functional limitations within a
working dashboard. Salt icons can be imported into a dashboard as SVG images, but cannot be ‘hooked up’ to any logic/code
that enables the icon to update or change a live status as part of the dashboard’s requirements.
For example, in the ‘Salt dashboard example’, the positive metric uses an ‘up’ arrow to indicate success/increase in value. If this
was to change to a negative value, an imported Salt arrow icon would not change in line with this status.
Instead, an alternative solution is to use the Windows character map utility to copy and paste characters such as up/down
arrows as part of the metric text. This then allows a metric to adapt to the dashboard’s functional requirements.
