title: Border Layout
data:
  description: Border Layout manages the top-level layout of your application, website, or widget. It defines five distinct regions, with four surrounding a main content region. You can use them for elements such as a footer, header or side navigation. Border Layout builds on top of Grid Layout, and it's best to use it for entire website pages or application screens, where there's at least one additional region alongside the main area.
