### Best practices

- On focus, the screen reader should:
  - Identify the switch.
  - Read out the text.
  - Express the state.

### Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- If focus is on the previous element in the tab order, moves focus to switch.
- If focus is on switch, moves focus to the next focusable element in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Space">

- Activates switch to change state.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- If focus is on switch, moves focus out of the component and sets the focus to the previous component in the tab order.
- If focus is below switch, moves focus to switch.

</KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>
