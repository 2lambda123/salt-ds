title: Badge
data:
  description: A Badge is a numeric annotation that indicates the number of outstanding items that need to be addressed. It can appear in the top right of an element (usually an icon) or inline next to an element. For numerical characters the badge will truncate after 3 digits. For strings there is no inbuilt truncation but it is advised to not exceed 4 characters. Badge is used to reflect a change of state and should therefore be used in conjunction with integrative components e.g Button and List
