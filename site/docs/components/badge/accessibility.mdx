- If custom colors are used, consider the minimum contrast guidance outlined in WCAG 2.1 documentation. The document recommends that the visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
- We recommend only using the accent color for Badge. But for overrides, you should consider accessibility where possible.
