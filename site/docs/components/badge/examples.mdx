    ### Default (top-right)

    By default, Badge is in the top-right corner when attached to a child component such as an icon.


    #### Guidance

    - Badge visually anchors to the attached component. As the number of alphanumeric characters increases, the Badge width expands, but stays in the same place.
    - Use Badge in the top-right corner to summarize the overall state of the content the Badge is anchored to. For example, you may want to provide a quick overview of the number of new or unread items, using numeric values.

    ### Inline Badge

    To place a Badge inline instead of in the top-right corner of an element simply don't pass `children` to Badge.

    #### Guidance

    Using Badge inline with text clarifies which part of the content the Badge relates to and allows specific details to be highlighted within the content to draw the userâ€™s attention. For example, you may use Badge within Tab, inline with the text.

    ### Badge with maximum digits

    Specify the maximum displayed number with the `max` prop. If `value` exceeds `max`, it will clamp the value and append a (`+`) suffix.

    #### Guidance

    - When you don't pass a max value to the component, the value will have a limitation of three digits by default, displaying 999+ for any values over 999.

    ### Badge with string

    The `value` property can accept both a `number` and a `string`.
