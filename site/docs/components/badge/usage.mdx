### Using the Badge component

#### When not to use Component Name

- Badge must not indicate status through color, such as red-amber-green or progress. Instead, use the Pill component.
- Donâ€™t allow users to edit the contents of Badge. To accept user input, consider using an interactive Pill.

### Import

{/* Update the text and code snippet below as needed: */}

To import Badge from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { Badge } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

### Props

{/* TODO: Update this to grab from core package when component is released */}

<PropsTable packageName="labs" componentName="Badge" />

### Content

- If a numeric annotation exceeds the max value passed as a prop, a plus (+) sign will be displayed after the max value stated. In the case that no max value is passed to the component, the value will truncate after 3 digits and therefore display 999+ for any values over 999.
- For strings there is no inbuilt truncation but it is advised to not exceed 4 characters.
