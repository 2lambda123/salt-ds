### When to use Accordion

- To organize related content within expandable groups/categories/sections.

- To reduce scrolling or overall page length when displaying content in full isn't critical.

- When you can't display all the content at once due to restricted screen space.

### When not to use Accordion

- You shouldn't use this component with grids to replace grouped rows.
