### When to use Pagination

Use Pagination when presenting a large amount of content that may take time to load, or when users need to review or navigate to content that’s split across sequential pages.

The component offers several benefits to users, and you can use it to:

- Organize and present search results or data within a grid.
- Provide a natural break point that allows users to determine if they’ve found what they need, or must navigate to another page or refine their initial query—when viewing the results of a search or data query.
- Enable users to reference specific pages within a set of results, for example, returning to an article on page 4.

### When not to use Pagination

- This component is not intended for use with grids to replace grouped rows.
