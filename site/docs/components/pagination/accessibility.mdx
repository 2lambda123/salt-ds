### Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

Moves focus into the Pagination component, setting focus to the first active button.

If the first page is active, sets focus on the first page. If any other page is active, focus is set on the “previous” button. If the input field is present and positioned on the left of Pagination, focus is initially set in the field.

If focus is inside the Pagination group, moves focus to the next item within the tabbing order.

If the last page is active and in focus, and the input field isn’t present on the right of Pagination, moves focus out of the component and onto the next component in the tabbing order. It ignores the “next” button, which would be disabled in this scenario.

If the last page is not active but is in focus, moves focus to the “next” button.
