### How to use the `NavigationItem` component

#### When to use `NavigationItem`

- When you have multiple levels of navigation in your application or website.

- We suggest first considering a horizontal group of navigation items for distinct webpages or applications. If you have multiple (more than eight) services to navigate to at a platform level, or have navigation across distinct apps, consider using a vertical group instead.

- If you need your items to remain visible on scroll, we recommend displaying navigation items in a fixed app Hhader (or header area).

#### When not to use `NavigationItem`

- When you need to show different views of content within the same page, consider using [`Tabs`](https://storybook.saltdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/documentation-lab-tabs--docs) instead.

- When your content is very specific. In this case, a minimalistic or single-page design may be more appropriate than a complex navigation structure. Consider using the [interactable `Card`](../card), or a [`Link`](../link) component within the body of the page.

### Import

To import `NavigationItem` from the lab Salt package, use:

```
import { NavigationItem  } from "@salt-ds/lab";
```

### Content

- To make the most of screen real estate, our recommendation is that all description text should be clear and concise.

- Always write descriptions in sentence case in a navigation item.

- When using a navigation item component within a navigation item, we recommend using sentence case.

- In a horizontal navigation item, do not wrap descriptions, use truncation with `Tooltip` if necessary.

- In a vertical navigation item, descriptions can wrap onto multiple lines if necessary, and is preferred over truncation.
