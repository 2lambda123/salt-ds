### Best practices

- On focus, the screen reader should:

  - Identify the radio button.
  - Read out the text.
  - Express the state.

### Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- Tab moves focus to the checked radio button in the radio button group.
- If the user hasn't checked a radio button, Tab moves focus to the first radio button in the group.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Space">

- If the user hasn't checked the radio button with focus, Space changes the state to checked.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Up arrow / Down arrow / Left arrow / Right arrow">

- This action moves focus between the available radio button options, and simultaneously selects an option.

</KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>
