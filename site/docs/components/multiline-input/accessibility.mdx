- Wrap `MultilineInput` in [`FormField`](/salt/components/form-field) to make it accessible within a form. This will provide the field with a visible label, help text and a status message for validation feedback. You can find more information [in the W3C form instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/instructions/).

- A multiline input will clip text that extends beyond its visible area. This behavior is common to all states, i.e., default, read-only and disabledâ€”whether or not the input has focus. To view the text in its entirety, the user can traverse the characters using the cursor.

### Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- If focus is above the multiline input, moves focus onto the multiline input and highlights the text. If the Multiline Input area is empty, it will display the text cursor.
- If the multiline input is disabled, skips the multiline input.
- If the multiline input has focus, moves focus out of the multiline input to next focusable component in the tab order.
