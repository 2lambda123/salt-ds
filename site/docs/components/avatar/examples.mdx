<LivePreview componentName="avatar" exampleName="Sizes" title="Sizes">

Each Avatar variant has a default size across all four densities, equal to the size foundation size-base; 20px (HD), 28px (MD), 36px (LD), and 44px (TD).
You can change the size of an Avatar in multiples of the base size.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="avatar" exampleName="fallBack" title="Fallback">

If a photo is not available, the Avatar will fall back to initials or an icon:

- `Initials` can be used when a photo is unavailable but profile information is;
- `Icon` can be used when neither a photo nor profile information are available.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="avatar" exampleName="alternativeFallback" title="Alternative fallback icon">

Avatar renders with an icon defined by `UserSolidIcon` but an alternative icon can be passed as `fallbackIcon`.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="avatar" exampleName="customImage" title="Custom image or SVG">

You can pass a custom image or SVG as the child of the component to be used as an image.

Note that for images passed as children, you will also need to handle the fallback logic.
