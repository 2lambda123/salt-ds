### When to use Tokenized Input Next

Tokenized Input Next is typically used within the context of a form. It’s ideal when you have a field that can contain multiple, specific values related to a single topic or context—and these values can be removed quickly and in their entirety. You would use the component, for example, in a field for email addresses or a fast field for a cash ticket.

### When not to use Tokenized Input Next

- Never use Tokenized Input Next as a standalone component; it will fail to meet ADA requirements.
- Consider the Combo Box component if you need to generate a list of suggested values that partially match the text entered by the user.
- Use a Combo Box when your selection is constrained to options in an existing dataset.

### Import

To import Tokenized Input Next from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { TokenizedInputNext } from "@salt-ds/lab";
```

### Props

<PropsTable componentName="TokenizedInputNext" />
