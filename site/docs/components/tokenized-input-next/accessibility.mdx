- Wrap Tokenized Input Next in a [Form Field](/salt/components/form-field) to make it accessible within a form. This will provide the field with a visible label, help text and a status message for validation feedback. More information can be found [in the W3C form instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/instructions/).

- Text that extends beyond the visible area of Tokenized Input is clipped. This behavior is common to all states, i.e., default, read-only and disabled—whether or not the input has focus. To view the text in its entirety, the user can traverse the characters using the cursor.

### Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">
  
- If focus is above the component, moves focus to the Tokenized Input. The input becomes active, with a visible text cursor.
- If focus is in the Tokenized Input (i.e., in the text input or on a token), moves focus to the field’s "X" button. If there’s text in the input field, tokenizes the text.
- If focus is on the "X" button, moves focus out of the Tokenized Input to the next component in the tab order.
</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- If focus is below the Tokenized Input, moves the focus to the collapsed button.
- If focus is in the "X" button, moves focus to the text input and the text cursor is displayed.
- If focus is in the text input or on a token, moves focus out of the Tokenized Input to the previous component in the tab order. If there’s text in the input field, tokenizes the text.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter, Comma">

- If visual focus is on the last token, removes focus from the tokens. The text input becomes active, with a visible text cursor.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Left Arrow">

- If the text cursor immediately succeeds the token group, moves visual focus to the last token.

- If visual focus is on a token, moves focus to the previous token.

- If visual focus is on the first token, does nothing.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Backspace">

- If the text cursor immediately succeeds the token group, moves visual focus to the last token.

- If visual focus is on a token, removes it from the field and sets focus on the preceding token.

- If there’s only one token with visual focus, removes the token. The text input becomes active, with a visible text cursor.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Home">

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="End">
