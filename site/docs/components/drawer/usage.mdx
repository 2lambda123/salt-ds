### Using the Component Name component

Use this component by wrapping it around your content and setting the desired position. For example:

```jsx
<Drawer isOpen={open} position="right">
  <DrawerContentExample />
</Drawer>
```

Provide a component like a Button so that users can open and close the Drawer.

The Drawer displays a visual overlay, also known as a scrim, over the existing content. It also plays relevant animations when opening and closing. You can disable all of these visuals via props.

#### When to use Drawer

Use Drawer when you need additional content, such as a form or sidebar navigation, to be displayed in a specific area of the screen.

#### When not to use Component Name

If you want your content split between pages or tabs, consider Deck Layout instead.
