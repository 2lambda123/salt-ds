### When to use Card

- To group related information with the same visual hierarchy
- To present a summary of a larger idea
- To link to more detailed information

### When not to use Card

- To display sequential information or emphasize ranking. Consider [List](../list) instead
- As a stand-alone call to action. Consider [Button](../button) instead
- For decoration purposes only

### Card groups

- Group Cards together in a layout using similar size and content length. If the content and size differs among Cards, consider layout customization such as a Mosaic grid.
- Avoid repeating images or content in a group of Cards.
- Use the same accent placement in a group if interactable.

### Interactable elements

A default Card can contain any UI elements, including actionable components such as [Buttons](../button) or [Links](../link). You can use these, for example, to link to more detailed information.

Interactable Cards shouldn't contain actionable components ([Buttons](../button) or [Links](../link)), as the Card itself is the interactive element.

### Import

To import Card from the core Salt package, use:

```
import { Card, InteractableCard } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

### Props

#### Card Props

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="Card" />

#### Interactable Card Props
