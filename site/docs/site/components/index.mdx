These are reusable components that are available for use within the Salt website, in addition to the standard Salt ones in the core, labs and other packages.

New pages/sections on the site should try to reuse these wherever appropriate, rather than inventing new, similar things. Bear in mind that these components can be extended to support new use-cases where needed.

If/when new site components are created, please consider documenting them here for better visibility.

Thanks!

### Longterm goals

At the moment, these components might be somewhat entangled with Mosaic or the Salt site specifically. Over time, it would be nice to make them more independent, so that they could be used by any Salt app. That would open the door to spinning them out into a "spoke" library of their own.
