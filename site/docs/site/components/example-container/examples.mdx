<LivePreviewControls>

<LivePreview componentName="example-container" exampleName="Neutral" >

By default, the Example Container will just display a frame around whatever content has been placed inside.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="example-container" exampleName="DoAndDont" >

To display contrasting positive ("Do") and negative ("Don't") examples, you can use the `type` prop. The example container will then display a pill-like indicator in its top right corner.

As shown in this example, you can use Salt's layout components to position related example containers side-by-side.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="example-container" exampleName="WithImage" >

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="example-container" exampleName="KitchenSink" >

As shown here, any HTML content or React components can be placed inside an Example Container.
