International address input gives users a set of form fields to input address information for specific countries.

The pattern is a form that displays relevant fields for a user-selected location. You can use it to provide consistent design when implementing international address input interactions across your applications. Future versions of the pattern will cover the use of APIs, autocompletion and enhanced support for more locations.

## Using the international address input pattern

#### When to use international address input

- When the user needs to enter an address for a specific country. This could be for shipping, contact, legal or compliance purposes, such as client onboarding flow or client detail collection processes.

#### When not to use international address input

- When the user may want to send any manner of information, such as to send a freeform message. In this case, users may not find an address input to be very useful.

## Best practices

The pattern aims to accommodate users worldwide, but your team may be able to take further steps that fall outside its scope. For example, check with your tech partners if it's possible to detect user location and automatically adjust the form.

## Basic layout

For layout guidance, refer to the [forms pattern](./forms).

### Dynamic format

Dynamic format generates templates based on country or region. The templates only display fields relevant to a specific country in a recognizable order and with familiar labels.

For the initial release, dynamic format supports five countries: France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.

We recommend using templates in dynamic format with localized language and terms that are more familiar to the user. This will reduce barriers to input and minimize user errors.

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="When to use">
- When users need to supply an address for one of the five supported countries.
- Combine dynamic format and generic format if users will input international addresses worldwide. You can provide templates using both generic and dynamic formats. 
<ExampleContainer>
<ExampleContainer type="negative" customPillText="When not to use">
- If users may need to input an address for an unsupported country, consider generic format instead.
- If requirements or product scope make it difficult to use templates, use the simpler generic format.

### Generic format

Generic format provides a single template of international address input for all countries and regions.

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="When to use">
- When using templates is difficult due to requirements or product scope.
- When you need to support countries other than the five supported by the dynamic format.
- Combine dynamic format and generic format if users will input international addresses worldwide. You can provide templates using both generic and dynamic formats. 
<ExampleContainer>
<ExampleContainer type="negative" customPillText="When not to use">
- When users need to supply an address for one of the countries supported by the dynamic format, consider using that format for ease of use.

## Anatomy

### Main address form fields

The address form fields enable users to input their information.

#### Components

- `FormField` acts as a wrapper for form fields.
- `Input` offers a field for users to input lines of their address.
- `ComboBox` and `Dropdown` offer lists of user-selectable options, such as countries. Use `Dropdown` when the list has fewer than 10 options and does not require filtering.

#### Additional fields

In some cases, you need to customize the address form while considering other information you're collecting based on the product scope.

- An additional form e.g., House No., may be needed.
- You can use the address form alongside international phone number, email address, banking details, time zone selection and other fields.

### Local language toggle

You can add a switch to toggle localization after the country selection, enabling users to compare the form with another address or data source.

</Diagrams>

#### Components

- `Toggle` enables users to switch between the languages.
- `CountrySymbol` can indicate languages where relevant.
