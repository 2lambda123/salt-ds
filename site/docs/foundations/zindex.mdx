Z-index determines the stacking order of elements. By providing consistent z-indexes, the design system ensures a predictable hierarchy of visual elements when stacked on top of one another. 

A component with a greater z-index, or stack order, will always appear in front of an element with a lower stack order.

Z-index is often used in combination with [Shadow](shadow) to help distinguish each layer in the stack.
