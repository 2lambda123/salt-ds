Z-index determines the stacking order of elements. By providing consistent z-indexes, the design system ensures a predictable hierarchy of visual elements when stacked on top of one another. 

A component with a greater z-index, or stack order, will always appear in front of an element with a lower stack order.

Z-index is often used in combination with [Shadow](shadow) to help distinguish each layer in the stack.

## Z-Index tokens

| Token                           | Value        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `--salt-zIndex-flyover`         | 1,500        |
| `--salt-zIndex-contextMenu`     | 1,450        |
| `--salt-zIndex-dragObject`      | 1,420        |
| `--salt-zIndex-notification`    | 1,400        |
| `--salt-zIndex-modal`           | 1,300        |
| `--salt-zIndex-drawer`          | 1,200        |
| `--salt-zIndex-appHeader`       | 1,100        |
| `--salt-zIndex-docked`          | 1,050        |
| `--salt-zIndex-popout`          | 1,000        |
| `--salt-zIndex-default`         | 1            |

## Default
`--salt-zIndex-default` represents the lowest layer in the stack. Its intended for any object that sits within the application layout, not over it. 

## Popout
`--salt-zIndex-popout`is used for any object that appears over the app layout in response to a user interaction and remains rooted to the element that triggered it, such as a [Tooltip](https://storybook.saltdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/documentation-core-tooltip--page). 

## Docked
`--salt-zIndex-docked` is intended for any panel that is aligned to one side of the app layout. 

## App header
`--salt-zIndex-appHeader` allows a 'header' object to sit at the top of an application. The placement of the header in combination with the z-index level allows content to scroll beneath it. 

## Drawer
`--salt-zIndex-drawer` is intended for use by the [Drawer](https://storybook.saltdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/lab-drawer--default) component. A Drawer aligns to one edge of an application; either top, right, bottom or left. It appears to sit above the app layout and header.

## Modal
`--salt-zIndex-modal` is used by a modal [Dialog](https://storybook.saltdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/lab-dialog--basic) which sits over the application and, through the inclusion of a scrim, blocks any underlying interactions in order to focus attention on the content of the dialog. 

## Notification
`--salt-zIndex-notification` allows an object to sit over the entire user interface in order to provide a status update or message, such as [Toast](https://storybook.saltdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/core-toast--default).  

## Drag object
`--salt-zIndex-dragObject` is intended to be used by any object that can be lifted off of the app layout and dragged over the interface.

## Context menu
`--salt-zIndex-contextMenu` a menu which appears over the UI on right-click.

## Flyover
`--salt-zIndex-contextMenu` an object that appears over the UI on hover.
