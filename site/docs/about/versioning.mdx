## Versioning strategy

Salt follows [semantic versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/). This means that the version number is composed of three numbers: `major`.`minor`.`patch`.

The `major` number is incremented when there are breaking changes.
The `minor` number is incremented when new functionality is added.
The `patch` number is incremented when bug fixes are made.

Below is a list of example changes and the corresponding version number increment:

### Major

- Removal of a component
- Removal of a prop
- Removal of a CSS variable from the theme

### Minor

- Addition of a component
- Addition of a prop
- Addition of a CSS variable to the theme
- Deprecation of a component or prop

### Patch

- Changes that do not affect a public API
- Style changes
- Changes to CSS classnames and HTML structure
