To help us track the state of a component, we use a set of milestones:

- Legacy
- Experimental
- In Progress
- RC (Release Candidate)
- Stable

Legacy, Experimental, In Progress and RC are all in `@salt-ds/lab`. Stable components are considered production ready and are in `@salt-ds/core`.

The aim of these milestones are to provide a clear indication of what to expect when using a component.

## Legacy

These are components that will not be worked on. They may be used in production, but should be considered unsupported. They may be removed at any time.

## Experimental

These are components that are not actively being developed. They may be used in production, but should be considered unsupported.

## In Progress

These are components that are actively being developed. They may be used in production, but should be considered unstable. Their API may change at any time.

## RC (Release Candidate)

These are components awaiting feedback from the community. They may be used in production, but should be considered unstable. Their API is unlikely to have breaking changes but might due to feedback.

## Stable

These are components that are considered production ready. They may be used in production and are considered stable. Their API will not have any breaking changes.
